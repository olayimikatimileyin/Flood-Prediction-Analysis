Flood Prediction Project in Lagos

This project aims to predict the occurrence of floods in Lagos using various weather and environmental factors. The analysis involves gathering historical flood data and correlating it with factors such as average precipitation, moon cycles, ocean levels, and wind patterns.

Project Overview

Goals

The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for floods in Lagos. This involves:

Gathering and preprocessing relevant data.

Performing exploratory data analysis.

Building and evaluating a predictive model.

Visualizing the results.

Business Needs

Flooding is a significant issue in Lagos, causing substantial damage to infrastructure and affecting the lives of many residents. Accurate flood prediction can help in better preparation and mitigation efforts, ultimately reducing the impact of floods.

Discovery Process The project involved collecting data from various sources, cleaning and preprocessing the data, performing exploratory data analysis, and building a predictive model. The insights gained from the analysis were used to refine the model and improve its accuracy.

Meaningful Insights The analysis revealed several key insights, including the importance of specific weather patterns and environmental factors in predicting floods. The model developed in this project can provide valuable predictions, aiding in flood preparedness and response efforts.

Data Collection

Historical Flood Data

Data on past flood incidents in Lagos was collected from various sources. This data included the dates, locations, and severity of floods.

Weather Data

Weather data for Lagos was obtained, covering various parameters such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind patterns. The dataset includes the following columns:

name datetime tempmax tempmin temp feelslikemax feelslikemin feelslike dew humidity solarenergy uvindex severerisk sunrise sunset moonphase conditions description icon stations

Environmental Data

Additional data on environmental factors such as ocean levels, wind patterns, and cloud cover was also collected.

Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to understand the distribution and relationships between various variables. Key steps included:

Descriptive statistics

Correlation analysis

Visualization of data distributions

Geospatial Analysis

Longitude and latitude values were used to geocode locations and identify neighboring areas. Geospatial analysis helped in understanding the spatial distribution of flood incidents and correlating them with weather patterns.

Outlier Detection

Outlier detection techniques were used to identify anomalies in the data, which could indicate potential flood events. Neighboring polling units were analyzed, and outlier scores were calculated to highlight areas at higher risk of flooding.

Predictive Modeling

Model Development

Various machine learning models were developed and evaluated to predict flood occurrences. The models were trained on historical data and tested for accuracy.

Model Evaluation

The performance of the predictive models was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best-performing model was selected based on these metrics.

Visualizations

Data Visualizations

Visualizations were created to illustrate key findings from the data analysis. These include:

Distribution of flood incidents over time

Correlation between weather parameters and flood occurrences

Geospatial maps showing high-risk areas

Predictive Model Results

The results of the predictive model were visualized to show the probability of flood occurrences under different scenarios.
